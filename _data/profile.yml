short_bio: >-
  &#x1F44B Hi I'm Tanzim. I'm a software engineer and aspiring researcher passionate about creating solutions that make lives better for people. My interest lies in the fields of <b>Software Engineering, AI/ML Security, Blockchain, and Image Steganography</b>, with a strong focus on <b>DevOps, Backend Engineering & AI Engineering</b>. I'm particularly interested in <b>Domain Driven Design, System Architecture, and Software Architecture</b>. Being both research and development oriented, I believe I can tackle challenges that require both kinds of efforts.
  <br/><br/>
  üî• <b>I'm a firm believer in the compound effect of consistent effort.</b> My daily routine includes dedicating time to learning new technologies, and staying updated with the latest research in my fields of interest. I maintain detailed learning logs and consistently apply new knowledge to real-world projects. This approach has enabled me to successfully juggle multiple research collaborations while excelling in my full-time engineering role. I'm driven by the philosophy that every line of code, every research insight, and every problem solved contributes to a larger mission of technological advancement.
  <br/><br/>
  üè´ I completed my B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from <b>Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology</b> with a <b>CGPA of 3.53/4.0</b>, demonstrating consistent academic excellence throughout my undergraduate program. Particularly noteworthy is my <span class="highlight-sessional"><b>3.86/4.0 GPA in Sessional Courses</b></span>‚Äîthe hands-on laboratory and project-based components that form the core of BUET's rigorous engineering curriculum. This achievement reflects my strength in collaborative programming projects, practical system implementations, and applied problem-solving. During my time at BUET, I received recognition for my academic achievements, including the <b>Dean's List Award</b> for exceptional performance and placing <a href="https://tanzimhromel.com/projects/bangla_digit_recognition/" target="_blank">2nd in the Bangla Handwritten Digits Recognition contest</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  üèÖ During my undergraduate studies, I was selected as a <b>finalist in the <a href="https://bcolbd.org/2021/teams" target="_blank">Blockchain Olympiad Bangladesh 2021 (BCOLBD 2021)</a></b> with our project "<a href="/projects/blockchain-ticketing" target="_blank">Blockchain Based Ticketing Platform</a>." I worked as part of the "Recursively Enumerable" team alongside <a href="https://fazledyn.github.io" target="_blank">Ataf Fazledin Ahamed</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-tanzim-azad-a879a51b7/" target="_blank">Md. Tanzim Azad Nishan</a>, developing a decentralized solution to address ticketing fraud and scalping issues through smart contracts and blockchain technology.
  <br/><br/>
  üíº I am currently a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/">IQVIA</a> (NYSE: IQV), a Fortune 500 company and global leader in healthcare data analytics, serving 90% of top pharmaceutical companies worldwide. At IQVIA, I develop microservices-based applications handling millions of patient records, implement observability solutions for critical healthcare data pipelines, architect cloud-native solutions on AWS, and integrate LLM capabilities into clinical data analytics dashboards for natural language querying and automated report generation.
  <br/><br/>
  üèÜ In May 2025, I received the <a href='https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Vc4E2RoQEPmbfS56oLdUih-oJDBok9sP/view?usp=share_link' target='_blank'><b>IQVIA Impact Program ‚Äì Silver</b></a> award for outstanding performance, critical issue resolution, and impactful feature development.
  <br/><br/>
  &#x1F4DC I'm currently working on research projects related to <a href="/research#research-projects">Machine Learning Security</a> (analyzing vulnerabilities in ML model hubs and developing security frameworks), <a href="/research#research-projects">Blockchain in Healthcare</a> (developing an advanced framework with sharding, Layer-2 solutions, and DAG ledger), <a href="/research#research-projects">LLM API Contract Analysis</a>, and <a href="/research#research-projects">Multi-Cover Image Steganography</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  ü§ù I'm fortunate to collaborate with esteemed researchers: <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/abmalimalislam/home" target="_blank">Professor A. B. M. Alim Al Islam</a> (BUET) on image steganography, <a href="https://akondrahman.github.io" target="_blank">Dr. Akond Rahman</a> (Auburn University, <a href="https://paser-group.github.io/" target="_blank">PASER group</a>) on LLM API contracts, and <a href="https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/asmlatifulhoque" target="_blank">Professor ASM Latiful Hoque</a> (BUET) on blockchain technology who was also my undergraduate thesis supervisor.
  <br/><br/>
  üåê I'm proud to have worked with the <a href="https://ureporter.cse.buet.ac.bd/about_us" target="_blank">uReporter team</a>, contributing to Bangladesh's first anonymous online reporting system designed to empower citizens to safely and effectively report social issues. This project has received coverage from international media including BBC Bengali, Saudi Gazette, and Global Voices. Our research on this work is currently <a href="/research#publications">under review at the ACM CSCW conference</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  üîÆ I consider myself a <b>perpetually curious learner</b> ‚Äî viewing each new technology not just as a tool, but as a lens through which to understand deeper computational principles. This mindset was cultivated through my admiration of interdisciplinary thinkers like Claude Shannon, who bridged mathematics and engineering, and Richard Feynman, whose playful approach to physics reminds me that the best innovations often happen when exploring at the boundaries of disciplines. I'm particularly drawn to the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leslie_Lamport" target="_blank">Leslie Lamport</a> in distributed systems and <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper_files/paper/2017/hash/3f5ee243547dee91fbd053c1c4a845aa-Abstract.html" target="_blank">pioneering research in attention mechanisms</a> that transformed modern AI. These inspirations fuel my approach to both engineering and research: build with precision, explore with curiosity, and always seek the elegant principles beneath complex systems.
  <br/><br/>
  üìö I'm currently reading <b>"Designing Data-Intensive Applications"</b> and <b>"Hands-On Large Language Models"</b> by Jay Alammar to deepen my understanding of data systems and LLMs. I'm also actively preparing for the <b>Certified Kubernetes Application Developer (CKAD)</b> and <b>AWS Solution Architect Associate</b> certifications to advance my knowledge in cloud infrastructure. You can check out my <a href="/learning">learning resource recommendations here</a>.
