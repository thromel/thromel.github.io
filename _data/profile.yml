short_bio: >-
  &#x1F44B Hi I'm Tanzim. I'm a software engineer and aspiring researcher passionate about creating solutions that make lives better for people. My interest lies in the fields of <b>Software Engineering, AI/ML Security, Blockchain, and LLM Systems</b>, with a strong focus on <b>DevOps, Backend Engineering & AI Engineering</b>. I'm particularly interested in <b>Domain Driven Design, System Architecture, and Software Architecture</b>.

  <br/><br/>
  üî• <b>I'm a firm believer in the compound effect of consistent effort.</b> My daily routine includes dedicating time to learning new technologies, and staying updated with the latest research in my fields of interest. I maintain detailed learning logs and consistently apply new knowledge to real-world projects. This approach has enabled me to successfully juggle multiple research collaborations while excelling in my full-time engineering role. I'm driven by the philosophy that every line of code, every research insight, and every problem solved contributes to a larger mission of technological advancement.

This achievement reflects my strength in collaborative programming projects, practical system implementations, and applied problem-solving. During my time at BUET, I received recognition for my academic achievements, including the <b>Dean's List Award</b> for exceptional performance and placing <a href="https://tanzimhromel.com/projects/bangla_digit_recognition/" target="_blank">2nd in the Bangla Handwritten Digits Recognition contest</a>.
  <br/><br/>
  üèÖ During my undergraduate studies, I was selected as a <b>finalist in the <a href="https://bcolbd.org/2021/teams" target="_blank">Blockchain Olympiad Bangladesh 2021 (BCOLBD 2021)</a></b> with our project "<a href="/projects/blockchain-ticketing" target="_blank">Blockchain Based Ticketing Platform</a>." I worked as part of the "Recursively Enumerable" team alongside <a href="https://fazledyn.github.io" target="_blank">Ataf Fazledin Ahamed</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/md-tanzim-azad-a879a51b7/" target="_blank">Md. Tanzim Azad Nishan</a>, developing a decentralized solution to address ticketing fraud and scalping issues through smart contracts and blockchain technology.
  <br/><br/>
  üíº I am currently a Software Development Engineer at <a href="https://www.iqvia.com/">IQVIA</a> (NYSE: IQV), a Fortune 500 company and global leader in healthcare data analytics, serving 90% of top pharmaceutical companies worldwide.

    GitHub, and developer forums covering LangChain, HuggingFace, and LlamaIndex. Pioneered LLM-based approach for automated contract extraction
    and validation in production systems. Currently developing Design by Contract (DbC) tools to automatically enforce API contracts, reducing LLM
    integration failures by proactive contract validation.
