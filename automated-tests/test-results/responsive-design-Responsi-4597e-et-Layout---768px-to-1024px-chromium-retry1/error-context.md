  - text: üëã Hi I'm Tanzim. I'm a software engineer and aspiring researcher passionate about creating solutions that make lives better for people. My interest lies in the fields of Software Engineering, AI/ML Security, Blockchain, and Image Steganography, with a strong focus on DevOps, Backend Engineering & AI Engineering. I'm particularly interested in Domain Driven Design, System Architecture, and Software Architecture. Being both research and development oriented, I believe I can tackle challenges that require both kinds of efforts. üî• I'm a firm believer in the compound effect of consistent effort. My daily routine includes dedicating time to learning new technologies, and staying updated with the latest research in my fields of interest. I maintain detailed learning logs and consistently apply new knowledge to real-world projects. This approach has enabled me to successfully juggle multiple research collaborations while excelling in my full-time engineering role. I'm driven by the philosophy that every line of code, every research insight, and every problem solved contributes to a larger mission of technological advancement. üè´ I completed my B.Sc in Computer Science and Engineering from Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology with a CGPA of 3.53/4.0, demonstrating consistent academic excellence throughout my undergraduate program. Particularly noteworthy is my 3.86/4.0 GPA in Sessional Courses‚Äîthe hands-on laboratory and project-based components that form the core of BUET's rigorous engineering curriculum. This achievement reflects my strength in collaborative programming projects, practical system implementations, and applied problem-solving. During my time at BUET, I received recognition for my academic achievements, including the Dean's List Award for exceptional performance and placing
