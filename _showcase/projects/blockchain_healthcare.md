    <h4>Project Overview</h4>
    <p>
        An advanced blockchain framework designed specifically for healthcare data management that incorporates sharding, Layer-2 solutions, 
        and a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) ledger structure to address scalability, security, and privacy challenges in healthcare information systems.

    <h4>Key Innovations</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Advanced Blockchain Architecture:</strong> Implemented a hybrid blockchain model combining sharding techniques for horizontal scaling, Layer-2 protocols for transaction throughput, and a DAG ledger structure for reduced consensus bottlenecks.</li>
        <li><strong>Patient-Centric Consent Management:</strong> Designed a granular consent system allowing patients to control access to specific portions of their medical records with time-bound permissions and purpose limitations.</li>
        <li><strong>Healthcare Standards Integration:</strong> Incorporated HL7 FHIR standards for semantic interoperability across healthcare systems while maintaining blockchain's immutability and audit capabilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy-Preserving Computation:</strong> Implemented zero-knowledge proofs and secure multi-party computation to enable analysis of healthcare data without exposing sensitive patient information.</li>
        <li><strong>Smart Contract Automation:</strong> Developed healthcare-specific smart contracts for automated insurance claims processing, clinical trial consent management, and drug supply chain verification.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Technical Implementation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Core Blockchain Layer</strong> – Custom DAG-based distributed ledger with modified consensus protocol optimized for healthcare verification workflows.</li>
        <li><strong>Sharding Implementation</strong> – Geographic and data-type based sharding to parallelize transaction processing while maintaining cross-shard consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>Layer-2 Scaling Solutions</strong> – State channels and rollups for high-throughput healthcare data transactions with periodic main-chain reconciliation.</li>
        <li><strong>FHIR Integration Layer</strong> – Healthcare data models and APIs built on HL7 FHIR resources with blockchain-backed verification.</li>
        <li><strong>Privacy Framework</strong> – Zero-knowledge proof implementation for privacy-preserving medical data verification without disclosure.</li>
    </ol>
