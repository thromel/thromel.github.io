<img src="{{ '/assets/images/go-database-architecture.png' | relative_url }}" class="img-fluid mb-4" alt="Go Database Engine Architecture">

## Introduction

Database engines are among the most complex and critical pieces of software infrastructure, powering everything from simple applications to massive distributed systems. While there are many excellent database solutions available, building one from scratch provides unparalleled insight into the fundamental concepts that drive modern data systems.

In this comprehensive project, I'm implementing a full-featured database engine in Go that combines educational depth with production readiness. The goal is to create a SQLite-like embedded database that leverages Go's strengths in concurrent programming while incorporating cutting-edge features like adaptive indexing and machine learning-enhanced query optimization.

## Project Vision and Goals

## Technical Deep Dive

### Storage Engine Design

The heart of any database is its storage engine, and this implementation features a sophisticated B+ tree design optimized for modern hardware:

```go
type BPlusTree struct {
    root      PageID
    height    int
    numKeys   int64
    pageCache *PageCache
    treeLatch sync.RWMutex
}

type Page struct {
    header PageHeader
    data   [PageSize - PageHeaderSize]byte
}

type PageHeader struct {
    PageID       PageID    // Unique page identifier
    PageType     PageType  // Leaf/Internal/Meta/Free
    LSN          uint64    // Log Sequence Number
    NumSlots     uint16    // Number of data slots
    FreeSpace    uint16    // Bytes of free space
    Checksum     uint32    // CRC32 checksum
}
```

Key design decisions include:
- **8KB pages** optimized for modern SSD performance
- **Variable-length keys and values** for flexibility
- **Sophisticated buffer pool** with LRU eviction and pin/unpin semantics
- **Page-level checksums** for corruption detection

### Transaction Architecture

The transaction system provides full ACID guarantees through careful coordination of multiple subsystems:

```go
type TransactionManager struct {
    nextTxnID  atomic.Uint64
    activeTxns map[TxnID]*Transaction
    lockMgr    *LockManager
    logMgr     *LogManager
    versionMgr *VersionManager
}

type Transaction struct {
    ID         TxnID
    State      TxnState
    IsolationLevel IsolationLevel
    StartTime  time.Time
    readSet    *ReadSet
    writeSet   *WriteSet
    undoLog    []UndoRecord
}
```

The transaction system implements:
- **Strict Two-Phase Locking** for serializability
- **Multiple isolation levels** from Read Uncommitted to Serializable
- **Deadlock detection** using wait-for graphs
- **Efficient rollback** using undo logging

### Query Optimization

The query optimizer uses both rule-based and cost-based techniques:

```go
type QueryOptimizer struct {
    rules        []OptimizationRule
    costModel    CostModel
    statistics   *StatisticsManager
    adaptiveOpt  *AdaptiveOptimizer
}

type PhysicalPlan interface {
    Execute(ctx context.Context) (ResultSet, error)
    EstimateCost() Cost
    ExplainPlan() string
}
```

Optimization techniques include:
- **Predicate pushdown** to reduce data movement
- **Join order optimization** using dynamic programming
- **Index selection** based on selectivity estimates
- **Parallel execution** leveraging Go's concurrency primitives

## Performance Characteristics

## Advanced Features Showcase

### Adaptive Indexing
One of the most innovative aspects of this database is its adaptive indexing system:

```go
type AdaptiveIndexManager struct {
    queryStats   *QueryStatistics
    indexAdvisor *IndexAdvisor
    builder      *IndexBuilder
    threshold    int
}

type QueryStatistics struct {
    predicateFreq map[Predicate]int64
    selectivity   map[Predicate]float64
    executionTime map[Predicate]time.Duration
}
```

The system automatically:
- **Analyzes query patterns** to identify frequently used predicates
- **Estimates selectivity** for potential index candidates
- **Creates indexes automatically** when benefit exceeds threshold
- **Monitors effectiveness** and removes ineffective indexes

### Time-Travel Queries
Building on the MVCC infrastructure, the database supports time-travel queries:

```sql
-- Query data as it existed at a specific timestamp
SELECT * FROM orders AS OF SYSTEM TIME '2024-01-01 12:00:00';

-- Find all changes to a record over time
SELECT * FROM audit_log 
WHERE record_id = 123 
ORDER BY system_time;
```

This feature enables:
- **Historical analysis** without separate audit systems
- **Data recovery** from accidental modifications
- **Regulatory compliance** with automatic audit trails

### ML-Enhanced Optimization
The query optimizer incorporates machine learning for improved decision-making:

```go
type MLOptimizer struct {
    model       MLModel
    features    *FeatureExtractor
    trainer     *OnlineTrainer
}

type QueryFeatures struct {
    TableSizes      []int64
    PredicateTypes  []PredicateType
    JoinTypes       []JoinType
    EstimatedCard   int64
}
```

The ML system:
- **Learns from execution feedback** to improve cost estimates
- **Adapts to workload changes** automatically
- **Provides explainable decisions** for query plan selection
